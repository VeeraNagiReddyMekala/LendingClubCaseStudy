## General Information
- The large finance company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- ### Background
- Applied the Exploring Data Analysis concepts to understand, clean, enhance the data, derive key insights and patterns from it. Provide the recommendations to business to help them understand the reasons behind becoming the default. Financial company will enhance the process and checklists while issuing the loans such that can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. The insights also helpful to get the employees where the credibility of the paying loans is high. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
- ### Business Objective:
- Help the consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to the customers in their risk analytics. This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. The input data contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicates when a person is likely to become default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
  
- ### Dataset
  Past Loan data which contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011 has been given as input for analysis.

## Conclusions
- From the analysis of input data using EDA, we got the below key insights.
  
  1. Employee Grade is a clear driving factor of loan default. Higher the chances of getting charged off/loan default with the lower the grade employee. G grade is most probable of defaulter and A grade is less probable to default the loan based on the history of the supplied input data.
  2. Lesser experienced employees are more chances to be default. The loan whereas employees having 10+ years of working experience have considerably less probable to default the loan. So, it's recommended to approve the loan for people who are working in stable jobs since considerably a good amount of time.
  3. The Interest rate shows a pattern where high interest rate leads to higher chances of Charged Off. i.e., people who are willing to go for high interest rates, have more probability of being defaulted the loan.
  4. Loan default cases are attributable to Total Principal received, Outstanding principle and last payment. A higher principle could imply to the higher risk of default.
